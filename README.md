# E2E Data Analytics Projects
## [Ecommerce Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL)](https://github.com/vermaparul85/E2E-Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/Ecommerce-Data-Analysis)
**Project Overview:**
Objective of this project is to work with a real-world ecommerce dataset, and perform data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to uncover valuable insights.
* Data Extraction: Extracted the ecommerce dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle library in Python.
* Data Cleaning: Cleaned the column names using the Pandas library in Python.
* Data Loading: Created the necessary tables and loaded the data into SQL Server using Python libraries like SQLAlchemy and Pandas.
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyzed the data in Jupyter Notebook using the SQL Magic extension to execute SQL queries. The query results were then converted into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis and visualization, utilizing Pythonâ€™s powerful libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and relationships.

**Key Learnings:**
* Effectively using environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as credentials and passwords.
* Writing SQL queries directly within Jupyter Notebook using the SQL Magic extension, similar to querying in a database.
* Converting SQL query results into Pandas DataFrames for analysis and visualization within Jupyter Notebook.
